DESCRIPTION : 
Ask, Help, Find, Share, Discuss and Connect with people in your locality. 
Using Shout you can seek for information or help others by giving information about various things in your locality. No need to add friends or build network. Just download and start shouting. People around you are the people you interact with.
You can interact using your normal profile or you can create an Alter Ego profile which will help you to shout anonymously. The world's only app which helps you to give identity to even your anonymous profile. Gone are days when you would be referred as Mr/Miss Crown etc; have your own identity

WHY USE SHOUT:
★ Get help: New to the city ? Ask from people around you about the best in area
★ Converse: People around the world are using shout to neighborhood problems, crime, and other local issues
★ Meet people of similar interest: Get company for daily jogging, swimming or form teams for weekend football, cricket matches
★ Live Traffic Updates: Never get stuck in traffic jam, warn others with live traffic updates of your area
★ Reviews: Get first hand user reviews on restaurants, movies, plays, events.
★ Buy and Sell: get the best deals from people living next door, or sell your old stuff. But marketing from companies is banned
★ Stand for a Cause: Spread the good word about your social cause be it to gather support for street dogs, or to save trees.
★ Emergency Shouts: in case of natural disastrous call for help and warn others. Also shout to get blood in case of emergency

Alter Ego Shout:
★ Shout Anonymously: Alter Ego as the name suggests is the other you.
★ Get Identity but remain Anonymous: Create your own avatar, chose your one time user name, and display pic, and be anonymous with an identity
★ All the normal shout features like Echo, Shut-up and comment are applicable to alter ego shout too.
